### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### I'm Weena.

Welcome to my <b>GitHub account!<b>

I am currently a third year Computer Science student at UBC Vancouver. During my free time, I like to cook, watch animes/TV series, or go out for a walk. 

My portfolio can be found [here]([https://weenawibowo.netlify.app/](https://weenawibowo.github.io/portfolio2024/))!

`Talk again soon!`
